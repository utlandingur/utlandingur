# I'm Luke - a front-end developer in Iceland
After spending 9 years working in Tech as a Technical Product Manager (vörustjóri) I decided to teach myself development so I could build the app for my startup, Tengdu.

- I started teaching myself frontend development in December 2023 with the Codecademy Front End Web Development course
- I built a social connection app with [sessihers](https://github.com/sessihers) from Feb to July 2024. I wrote the majority of the frontend code whilst he focussed on the backend. You can see the forked source code in [tengdu-public](https://github.com/utlandingur/tengdu-public)
- I started studying web development at Vefskóli Íslands August 2024.
- I am rebuilding Vefskóli's learning management system according to their redesigns in [io.vefskoliv2](https://github.com/ellertsmari/io.vefskoliv2)
- I also have a 1st class BSc in Mathematics from the University of Leeds.
- I can walk on my hands, jump 154cm onto a box and have bench pressed 145kg
