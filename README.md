## ü§î FAQs

### What motivated me to transition from a Technical Product Manager to a Front-End Developer?
After spending 9 years in tech as a Technical Product Manager, I realized that I wanted to be directly involved in building products. This passion led me to teach myself development to create my startup, Tengdu.

### How do I approach learning new technologies?
I‚Äôm continuously learning, but I work best when given a problem to overcome. I find effective solutions rather than relying solely on tutorials or learning for learning‚Äôs sake.

### Do I test my code?
Yes! As you can see from my pinned repos, I ensure my code is stable in production and that issues are flagged early. My best tests can be found in the io.vefskoliv2 repo.

### Have I worked with other developers before?
Yes, I worked on Tengdu with my co-founder Sessihers where we imployed version control, pull requests and branch management.

### Do I need handholding?
I have never had my hand held during my journey as a developer or in my previous career as a Technical Product Manager. I identify what needs to be done and figure out how to do it. That said, I always seek constructive feedback and advice to improve my skills and the code I write.

### Do I enjoy programming?
Absolutely! I love it.
