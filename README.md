Hi, I'm a British guy living and studying in Iceland

I started teaching myself frontend development in December 2023 and built a social connection app from February to july 2024. You can see the source code in tengdu-public

I started studying web development at Vefskóli Íslands August 2024

Fun fact: I can walk on my hands
